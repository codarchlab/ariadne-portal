This open source software is available from the following GitHub repository: https:\/\/github.com\/DANS-KNAW\/dccd-webui\r\nThe DCCD software is an online digital archiving system for dendrochronological data. A recent version of this software (system) is deployed as 'Digital Collaboratory for Cultural Dendrochronology' (DCCD) at http:\/\/dendro.dans.knaw.nl. \r\nMore information about the Digital Collaboratory for Cultural Dendrochronology (DCCD) project can be found here: http:\/\/vkc.library.uu.nl\/vkc\/dendrochronology.\r\nThe DCCD is the primary archaeological\/historical tree-ring (meta)data network existing in Europe. It became operational in 2011. Within the DCCD Belgian, Danish, Dutch, German, Latvian, Polish, and Spanish laboratories have joined data in a manner that suits their shared and individual research agendas. In its present state the DCCD contains measurement series of different wood species derived from objects and sites dating between 6000 BC and present. All data sets are described with very detailed metadata according to the newly developed international dendrochronological data standard TRiDaS (Jansma et al. 2010). The collection is derived by research from archaeological sites (including old landscapes), shipwrecks, historical architecture and mobile heritage (e.g. paintings, furniture).",

In addition we connect terms and concepts by SKOS links to external thesauri, like the Arts & Architecture Thesaurus of the Getty Institution.",

Arachne is intended to provide archaeologists and Classicists with a free internet research tool for quickly searching hundreds of thousands of records on objects and their attributes. It provides an online data deposit service.This combines an ongoing process of digitizing traditional documentation (stored on media which are both threatened by decay and largely unexplored) with the production of new digital object and graphic data. Wherever possible, Arachne follows a paradigm of highly structurized object-metadata which is mapped onto the CIDOC-CRM, to address machine-readable metadata strategies of the Semantic Web. This \u201cstructured world\u201d of Arachne requires large efforts in time and money and is therefore only possible for privileged areas of data. While there is an ever-increasing range of new, \u201cborn digital\u201d data, in reality only a small effort-per-object ratio can be applied. It therefore requires a \u201clow-threshold\u201d processing structure which is located in the \u201cunstructured world\u201d of Arachne. All digital (graphic and textual) information is secure on a Tivoli Storage System (featuring long-term multiple redundandancy) and distributed online through the Storage Area Network in Cologne via AFS.",
